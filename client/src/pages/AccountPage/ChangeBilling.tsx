                    When you receive a payment for a order, we call that payment
                    to you a "payout." Our secure payment system supports
                    several payout methods, which can be set up below. Go to
                    FAQ.

                <p>
                    To get paid, you need to set up a payout method releases
                    payouts about 24 hours after a guestâ€™s scheduled time. The
                    time it takes for the funds to appear in your account
                    depends on your payout method.
